                    <p>Hi, I am Wali Ullah Ripon. My nick name is Ripon. I am a student of Daffodil International University under CSE department.
                        Another of my identity is that I am a Social Media Manager at Hacker Slash. There are no people today who are not connected to social media. Now a days social media is playing an important role in modernizing our society.
                         I like to explore and learn new things and I believe that learning comes from inner-self. I am a quick self-learner. I have been teaching myself difference that otherwise would be impossible for my teachers. Iâ€™m a student of science background. My fascination and expertise of technology. 
                        I was able to conquer my untapped world with just my curiosity and a few tools in hand that most people own now-a-days. 
                        I know about Python, Java, C, C++ language.
                        I'm also interested in Syber Security, Robotic and Research.
                        </p>
